As you may be aware of, there is certainly a lot of room for improvements over the initial single-frequency interaction (it is too simple as you pointed out). I propose these major changes below.

1) Antennas of a host vessel

Assignment of one frequency to each antenna
A custom name to distinguish from other identical antennas on the host vessel
Can only key in one of the existing frequencies with a few exceptions (when an existing constellation is deleted, only update vessel's frequency list)
Stock Comm Power of the antenna will be preserved
By default, the frequency will be the public one (0)
The stock antenna combination will be preserved though it is applicable to the same frequency.

2) Probe core/manned pod parts of a host vessel

Each part stores a list of frequencies persistently. In the scenario of a multi-staging vessel (mothership and landers), newly-staged vessels rebuild their lists from their own antennas
By default, the list of unique frequencies is constructed from all the antennas
A button in the Part-Action menu to bring up an user interface to manage the said list

3) Management interface of a host vessel

The obsolete "Talk to members only" option will be removed since desired frequencies can be explicitly assigned to the vessel
Display a stored list of frequencies (Active Frequency List)
Optional functions on the list
- Activate/de-activate some antenna-frequencies in the list (the whitelist/blacklist)
- ???

4) Connection between two nodes based on their Active Frequency Lists

Since the antennas of a vessel can be configured independently, the connection will be the strongest link of the antennas' matching frequency, instead of juggling multiple matching frequencies.
For example, Vessel A has Antenna X of Freq 1 and Comm Power 50k and Antenna Y of Freq 2 and Comm Power 10k. Vessel B has Antenna Z of Freq 1 and Comm Power 20k and Antenna Y of Freq 2 and Comm Power 30k. Then, the connection between Vessels A and B is the link of Antenna X and Z since this link is stronger than the link of Antenna Y's.
