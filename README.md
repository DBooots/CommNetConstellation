# What is this?
A gameplay add-on for Kerbal Space Program. The purpose is to transform the CommNet network of the single type into multiple constellations of different types.

# Why?
Three reasons:
* In our real-life universe, we have satellite constellations of GPS, GLONASS and Galileo talking to their own members. So why can't CommNet have such feature?
* Every vessel in the whole network is talking to everyone within its root range model.
* This mod is a testbed and prototype for one feature proposal of constellations in the [RemoteTech](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech) project.
