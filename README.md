# What is this?
A gameplay add-on for Kerbal Space Program. The purpose is to transform the CommNet network of the single type into multiple constellations of different types.

Major features:
* Make a group of satellites (a constellation) working together to archive a single purpose eg Global GPS, Ground-to-Air Communication
* Assign a vessel to one or more constellations
* Edit a ground station
* Colored connections and icons in Map View
* Built directly on KSP's CommNet infrastructure
* Many frequencies (up to 32,767!) to choose for a vessel or constellation
* Color Picker for "infinite" color choices
* User-friendly interfaces, included the sort and filter capabilities for the vessel list

Bonus: Designed by a RemoteTech developer as a proof-of-concept of one feature of RemoteTech 2.x re-development

# Why?
Three reasons:
* In our real-life universe, we have satellite constellations of GPS, GLONASS and Galileo talking to their own members. So why can't CommNet have such feature?
* Every vessel in the whole network is talking to everyone within its root range model.
* This mod is a testbed and prototype for one feature proposal of constellations in the [RemoteTech](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech) project.
